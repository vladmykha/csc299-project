# Task 1 Plan – Charter & Research

## Objective
Establish the Campus Connect assistant concept using AI tooling so the remainder of the project has a clear scope, data model, and success criteria.

## Inputs from assignment
- Worksheet emphasis on PKMS, task manager, chat, and AI agents.
- Requirement to document planning artifacts generated with LLM support.

## Steps
1. Brainstorm the product vision and pain points (grades, financial aid, schedules, advising).
2. Draft the top-level README explaining motivation and feature map.
3. Use GPT-5.1 Codex to generate a detailed project plan covering architecture, workflows, data model, AI strategy, milestones, and risks.
4. Create a representative Campus Connect snapshot (`data/campus_connect_sample.json`) to anchor requirements.

## Deliverables
- Updated `README.md`.
- `docs/PROJECT_PLAN.md`.
- Sample data JSON for future tasks.

## Evidence of completion
The README references the course worksheet and outlines the PKMS/task/chat/agent features, while the project plan documents complete architecture and milestone breakdowns. Sample data includes grades and financial aid examples that future tasks consume.
