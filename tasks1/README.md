# Task 1 – Project Charter & Research

This milestone mirrors Task 1 from the CSC 299 project rubric: use AI-first planning to lock the project scope, success criteria, and initial system design before writing production code.

## Goals
- Summarize the Campus Connect assistant vision (Pulse-style experience focused on grades, financial aid, and scheduling).
- Capture AI-assisted planning artifacts (vision, scope, workflows, data model, risks).
- Stand up the course-facing README so reviewers understand the intent of the repo.

## Key Artifacts

| Deliverable | Location | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Project overview & motivation | `README.md` | Introduces PKMS, task manager, AI agents, and alignment with assignment requirements. |
| Project plan | `docs/PROJECT_PLAN.md` | AI-generated vision, architecture, data model, workflows, milestones, risks. |
| Sample Campus Connect data | `data/campus_connect_sample.json` | Used for later tasks; created during planning to anchor requirements. |

## How it was produced
All documents were drafted with GPT-5.1 Codex following the assignment worksheet. The plan document specifically calls out the five milestones that correspond to the remaining tasks.

## Verification checklist
- [x] README references the CSC 299 worksheet and explains the why/how.
- [x] Project plan covers architecture, data model, workflows, agents, and risks.
- [x] Sample data exists for grades, financial aid, and registration to drive later development.
