# Task 5 Plan – Mobile Login Mock & Roadmap

## Objective
Translate the CLI experience into a Pulse-style mobile vision by mocking the login/onboarding flow and describing how secure browser-based auth plus sync will work.

## Inputs
- Assignment emphasis on AI agents interacting with tasks/knowledge.
- Requirement to demonstrate planning/testing of the mobile experience.
- Feedback requesting a login popup similar to Google/Pulse.

## Steps
1. Map out the desired mobile flow (welcome, auth choice, embedded DePaul login, sync confirmation, failure states).
2. Document UI wireframes + explanatory notes in Markdown.
3. Update README quick-start to point to the new mock.
4. Tie the mock to the overall roadmap (browser automation + mobile client) in the project plan.

## Deliverables
- `docs/MOBILE_LOGIN_MOCK.md`
- README update referencing the mock.
- Cross-links from plan tasks + summary.

## Evidence
The mock document contains ASCII-based wireframes for four screens plus failure states and implementation notes (security, session storage, CLI parity). README now references the mock, and SUMMARY/task folders explain how this milestone satisfies Task 5.
